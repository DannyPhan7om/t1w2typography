In this challenge, we'll test your understanding of Typography in CSS. Modify the template to the right in the following ways:

 Modify the styling of the quotes so that they are all bolded.

Bonus: Can you make the text italics just with CSS? Try googling how it's done!

Change the font family of the h1 to be Comic Sans MS (aka the greatest font ever)


Modify the font size of the .quotes-section div so that it's 20px

Now change the font size of the .quote paragraphs so that they're 1.5em 

Question: How many px is their font size now?

Finally, change the font size of the .quotes-section div so that it's 10px 

Question: How did the em styled element change in relation to that?


Head over to fonts.google.com and find a font that would look good for quotes

Add the font to the webpage and use it as the font family for the .quote paragraphs.
